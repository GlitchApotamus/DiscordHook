This mod sends webhooks to discord during certain events and calls in game. If you want more features, just open an issue or see my channel in the Discord below.\
If you like my mod, I would very appreciate if u leave a like ðŸ’œ

## Prerequisites



## Configuration

Set up the config file. You can choose to send the messages as an embed by ticking `Send as embed`, setting it to true (default is false).
`Webhook url` is required!
All other settings are optional but do have defaults also and only except string values.

# RepoConfig

If you use RepoConfig mod to set these settings in game, you will only see `Send as embed` due to the lack of `string` support in the mod.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use a mod manager like Gale, you can change the .cfg settings in the launcher itself.\
>  In order for the .cfg file to appear, you must launch the game once after installing the mod!
